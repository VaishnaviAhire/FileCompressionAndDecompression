# File Compression and Decompression System  

## Overview  
This project implements file compression and decompression using three advanced algorithms:  
1. **Huffman Compression**  
2. **LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) Compression**  
3. **QuadTree Image Compression**  

The primary focus of the project is achieving efficient compression and optimal compression ratios for various types of files, including text and images.

## Features  
- **Huffman Compression:** Efficient text-based compression for minimizing file sizes.  
- **LZW Compression:** Adaptable dictionary-based compression for text and binary files.  
- **QuadTree Image Compression:** Spatial approximation for reducing image file sizes.  
- **Menu-Driven Interface:** Easy navigation for choosing desired algorithms and operations.

## Problem Statement  
### Operations Supported:  
- **Compress (C):** Compress the given file.  
- **Decompress (D):** Restore a compressed file to its original state.  

### Example Outputs:  
#### LZW Decompression
